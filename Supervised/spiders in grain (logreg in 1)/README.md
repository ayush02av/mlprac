# GrainSize - Spiders (Logistic Regression in 1 Variable)

## What
1. Intro for Logistic Regression
2. Data Features:
    1. grain size (independent)
    2. spiders state (dependent)
3. Very small sample dataset with less accuracy

## How
1. Used Pandas, Matplotlib.Pyplot, Scikit Learn
2. Scikit-Learn Library:
    1. linear_model.LogisticRegression() for the model
    2. metrics.accuracy_score to calculate Accuracy

## What New
1. How is a Logistic Regression dataset different from Linear
2. How to visualize a classified dataset
3. Ineffective dataset leads to low accuracy (67% achieved)
