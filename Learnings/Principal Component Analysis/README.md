# Principal Component Analysis

## What
1. P.C.A. is a dimension reduction method that finds bestfit components with least variance loss
2. Helps in finding most needed features in the dataset for optimal accuracy
3. Standardization & Normalization

## How
1. Used Seaborn.breast_cancer dataset with 30 features
2. Sklearn Library
    1. preprocessing.StandardScaler for Sormalization
    2. decomposition.PCA for Principal Component Analysis

## What New
1. Intuition behind multi-featured datasets
2. New techniques for data preprocessing
