# Intuition and Working Behind Principal Component Analysis

## What
1. P.C.A. is a dimension reduction method that finds bestfit components with least variance loss
2. Helps in finding most needed features in the dataset for optimal accuracy
3. Approach behind how PCA works

## How
1. Checked explained_variance_ratio_ of different features after standardization of the data
2. Dropped down the features with least explained variance ratio, to get the most needed features

## What New
1. Intuition behind PCA
2. explained_variance_ratio_
