# Sample (Linear Regression in 1 Variable)

## What
1. Second Machine Learning model with Linear Regression
2. Data Features:
    1. x (independent)
    2. y (dependent)
3. 1000 rows of data with separate training & testing

## How
1. Used Pandas, Matplotlib.Pyplot, Scikit Learn
2. Scikit-Learn Library:
    1. train_test_split from model_selection
    2. LinearRegression from linear_model
    3. LinearRegression().score to calculate Accuracy

## What New
1. How to fill NULL values using .fillna() function
2. How to divide dataset into train and test sets for testing the model accurately
3. Intuition behind how ML models work
